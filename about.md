    ## About Me

    ### Who

    My name is Rathin Sinha. I am an AI enthusiast with particular interests in the application of this technology in healthcare,            fintech, entertainment, and disaster management. Artificial Intelligence has been at the forefront of what is termed as the Fourth       Industrial revolution or, Industry 4.0. The technology and its sub-branches are being adopted in every sector. With this in mind,        I have decided to equip myself with as much knowledge and skills regarding AI as I can.


    ### Goals and Objectives

    Despite AI being ubiquitous as well as the face of new technology, many experts, particularly in non-tech sectors, are not entirely      convinced of its applications. This scepticism stems from malicious uses of AI that often make headlines and leave severe    
    repercussions. What I aim to achieve is to have enough theoretical and pratical knowledge of AI to advise businesses a
    organisations of its applications that achieve the best results.
