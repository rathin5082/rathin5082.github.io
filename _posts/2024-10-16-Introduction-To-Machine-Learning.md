### Projects and Activities

1. #### [Correlation and Regression analysis](https://rathin5082.github.io/subfiles/Corr-Reg.html)
   - I conducted analyses using four Jupyter Notebook programs to understand how changes in data points impact correlation and            regression. The programmes were based on Covariance and Pearson Correlation, Linear Regression, Multiple Linear regression, and      Polynomial regression. The main takeaway of these experiments was how the relationship between variables changes by changing         the data points.
    

2. #### [Jaccard Coefficient Calculation](https://rathin5082.github.io/subfiles/JCC.html)
   - I calculated Jaccard Coefficient for three individuals named Jack, Mary and Jim based on their pathological test results.

4. #### [Gradient Descent and Cost Function](https://rathin5082.github.io/subfiles/Gradient-Descent.html)
   - The goal was to explore the gradient descent algorithm and its impact on the cost function through iterative adjustments of the      learning rate and the number of iterations. Through the experimentation with gradient descent and the cost function, it becomes      clear that the choice of learning rate and the number of iterations significantly impacts the optimization process. Properly         tuning these parameters is essential for effective model training and achieving minimal cost.
   
6. #### [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://rathin5082.github.io/subfiles/CNN.html)
   - The task involved running a CNN model and experimenting with input images to assess prediction accuracy. Through the                 exploration of CNNs for object recognition, it was observed that these networks are powerful tools capable of learning complex       features from images. The hands-on experimentation reinforced the understanding of how modifications in input can influence          model predictions, ultimately underlining the need for careful dataset selection and model tuning for improved accuracy in           real-world applications.
