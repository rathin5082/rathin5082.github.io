## Content Overview

This section covers the Collaborative Discussion Forum Summaries, Outcomes from the Team Exercises, Reflective Piece.

### Projects and Activities

1. ***Correlation and Regression analysis***
   - I conducted analyses using four Jupyter Notebook programs to understand how changes in data points impact correlation and            regression.
   - **Covariance and Pearson Correlation**
     -  I explored the relationship between different variables and found that as data points varied, the correlation coefficient            changed significantly, reflecting the strength of their relationship.
   - **Linear Regression**
     -  By adjusting independent variables, I observed how the regression line fitted the data, emphasizing the importance of                variable selection.
   - **Multiple Linear Regression** 
     - This analysis involved multiple independent variables, revealing how interactions among variables can influence outcomes.
    
   - **Polynomial Regression**
     - I compared polynomial fits to linear models and found that polynomial regression could capture more complex relationships            within the data.


2. **Resources**
   - Access various resources such as PDFs, videos, and tutorials to deepen your understanding of machine learning.
