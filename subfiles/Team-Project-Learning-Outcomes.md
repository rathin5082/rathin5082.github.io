    <h2>Project</h2>
    <p>
      The project we worked on involved business analysis of the Airbnb dataset using a data science approach. My team included five people and three roles. We had one project lead, two people who performed exploratory data analysis, and two people who were tasked with machine learning modeling. I, alongside another member, was tasked with performing machine modeling.
    </p>

    <h2>Tasks</h2>
    <p>
      My partner and I used Scikit-Learn to perform Machine Learning modeling on the Airbnb dataset. We wanted to identify what key factors influence the price of Airbnb listings in New York City. This type of analysis required an unsupervised learning algorithm called clustering. The dataset consisted of both categorical and numerical features. To determine the optimal clustering algorithm, my teammate and I had lengthy discussions and conducted research.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was decided that given the nature of the dataset, K-prototype clustering, which is suited for handling both categorical and numerical data, would be appropriate.
    </p>

    <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
    <p>
      I realized that different kinds of data and different kinds of analyses require different machine-learning techniques. As a data analyst, scientist, or machine learning engineer, one needs to be precise about what kind of algorithm is the best solution for a given problem. This project enhanced my critical and analytical thinking in this regard.

    <p>
      I also realized what makes a good and efficient team and what it takes to be a good team member. The most important aspect of an effective team is organization. Every team should break its main goal into multiple sub-goals, just like a software program. Depending on the team's size, every sub-goal should be worked on by a number of people with cooperative behaviors. The team needs a project lead, who should manage the tasks, handle the deadlines, and bring the project together.
