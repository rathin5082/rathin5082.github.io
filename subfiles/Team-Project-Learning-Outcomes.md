## Project

The project we worked on involved business analysis of the Airbnb dataset using a data science approach. My team included five people and three roles. We had one project lead, two people who performed exploratory data analysis, and two people who were tasked with machine learning modeling. I, alongside another member, was tasked with performing machine modeling. 

## Tasks

My partner and I used Scikit-Learn to perform Machine Learning modeling on the Airbnb dataset. We wanted to identify what key factors influence the price of Airbnb listings in New York City. This type of analysis required an unsupervised learning algorithm called clustering. The dataset consisted of both categorical and numerical features. To determine the optimal clustering algorithm, my teammate and I had lengthy discussions and conducted research.

It was decided that given the nature of the dataset, K-prototype clustering, which is suited for handling both categorical and numerical data, would be appropriate.
