## Project

The project we worked on involved business analysis of Airbnb dataset using data science approach. My team included five people and three roles. We had one project lead, two people who performed exploratory data analysis, and two people who were tasked with machine learning modelling. I, alongside another member, was tasked with performing machine modelling. 

# Tasks

Me and my partner used Scikit-Learn to perform Machine Learning modelling on Airbnb dataset. In the dataset, we wanted to identify what key factors influence the price of Airbnb listings in New York City. This type of analysis required unsupervised learning algorithm called clustering. The dataset consisted of both categorical and numerical features. For this purpose, me and my teammate had lengthy discussions and did our research about which clustering algorithm would be optimal for the task.

It was decided that given the nature of the dataset, K-prototype clustering, which is suited for handling both categorical and numerical data, would be appropriate.
