    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      
Klaus Schwab (2016) paints the picture of the Fourth Industrial Revolution as the most distinct metamorphosis in the technological landscape when juxtaposed with the ones in human history. What essentially differentiates this shift is the incorporation digital technologies and big data. However, with this large-scale transition, Schwab has also raised many concerns. 

The debacle of IBM Watson for Oncology discussed in my initial post sheds insight into what Schwab feared. In what could have been a monumental achievement in the era of big data and digitisation, a phase of mistrust over adopting cyber technologies in the healthcare industry began with this incident (IBS, 2022). The system's lack of training with real-world data and inability to handle biases have become prevalent concerns regarding the data used for algorithm development. 

Going through the posts made by my peers, it has become evident that AI systems face monumental challenges across the finance and aviation industries as well. 

My peers made several responses to my post, all of which highlighted multiple challenges of Industry 4.0. Tala made a great point about the need for historical understanding to make progress in the development of AI algorithms and data representation. The insufficiency of high-quality data and lack of ethical measures can pose a serious challenge for AI to take centre stage in the current era. 

Aside from the shortcomings of digital systems, the success of Industry 4.0 also depends on the needs and willingness of the organisations. Aminur Rahman discussed a very significant point stating the need for various industries to partake in the digital revolution. To successfully implement these models, a strong cybersecurity culture must be established by familiarizing all sectors with cybersecurity systems. Learning about security frameworks, audits and staff training can prove vital in preventing large-scale failures of information systems in the future(Kokolakis, 2017).
