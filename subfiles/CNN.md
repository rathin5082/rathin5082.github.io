## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

### Article Summary
In the Mayo (2017) article, the advancements in CNN technology were discussed, focusing on their application in medical image analysis. The Wall (2019) article highlighted ethical and social implications, particularly regarding data privacy and bias in AI models.

### Ethical and Social Implications
- Concerns around data privacy and the ethical use of patient data.
- Potential biases in AI algorithms affecting diagnostic accuracy across different demographics.

### CNN Model Execution
I ran the `Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) - Object Recognition.ipynb` and experimented with different input images for prediction. 

- **Changed Input Image**: `plt.imshow(x_test[5])` 
- **Prediction Accuracy**: The model correctly identified the object in the image with a confidence score of 84%.
