## Jaccard Coefficient Calculation: 

It is a statistical measure used to assess similarity between different sets. I calculated the Jaccard coefficients for three pairs of individuals based on their test results, yielding the following values:

- **(Jack, Mary)**: 0.33
- **(Jack, Jim)**: 0.25
- **(Jim, Mary)**: 0.33

### Interpretation of Results:

The Jaccard coefficient ranges from 0 to 1. 0 indicates no similarity between the sets and 1 indicates total similarity.
These coefficients illustrate the similarity between individuals based on their test results, with values closer to 1 indicating greater similarity.

## Learning Outcomes

1. I learned the concept of JCC and how it is used to measure similarity between individuals based on quantitative data.
2. I learned how to calculate and programme JCC for different pairs.
3. I learned how to apply JCC in real-world scenarios such as collaborative projects.
4. My critical thinking skills improved by analysing the practical consequences of similarity metrics and how they may affect             optimisation and improvement efforts in various applications.
