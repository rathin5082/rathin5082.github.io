## Jaccard Coefficient Calculation:

It is a statistical measure used to assess similarity between different sets. I calculated the Jaccard coefficients for three pairs of individuals based on their test results, yielding the following values:

- **(Jack, Mary)**: 0.33
- **(Jack, Jim)**: 0.25
- **(Jim, Mary)**: 0.33

## Interpretation of Results:

The Jaccard coefficient ranges from 0 to 1. 0 indicates no similarity between the sets and 1 indicates total similarity.
These coefficients illustrate the similarity between individuals based on their test results, with values closer to 1 indicating greater similarity.
