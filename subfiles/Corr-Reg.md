- ## Covariance and Pearson Correlation
    -  I explored the relationship between different variables and found that as data points varied, the correlation coefficient              changed significantly, reflecting the strength of their relationship.

- ## Linear Regression
    -  By adjusting independent variables, I observed how the regression line fitted the data, emphasizing the importance of                  variable selection.

- ## Multiple Linear Regression
    - This analysis involved multiple independent variables, revealing how interactions among variables can influence outcomes.

    
- ## Polynomial Regression
    - I compared polynomial fits to linear models and found that polynomial regression could capture more complex relationships              within the data.
