- ## Covariance and Pearson Correlation
    -  I explored the relationship between different variables and found that as data points varied, the correlation coefficient            changed significantly, reflecting the strength of their relationship. Covariance provided insight into if the variables              tended to rise and fall together. However, it did lack a consistent measure of strength. Pearson Correlation was useful for          determining both the direction and the intensity of association by normalising the relationship between -1 and 1. Correlation        coefficient was greatly affected by the addition of outliers or by altering the distribution of data points. This emphasised         how sensitive Pearson correlation is to the variability and outliers in the dataset.

- ## Linear Regression
    -  By adjusting independent variables, I observed how the regression line fitted the data, emphasizing the importance of                  variable selection.

- ## Multiple Linear Regression
    - This analysis involved multiple independent variables, revealing how interactions among variables can influence outcomes.

    
- ## Polynomial Regression
    - I compared polynomial fits to linear models and found that polynomial regression could capture more complex relationships              within the data.
