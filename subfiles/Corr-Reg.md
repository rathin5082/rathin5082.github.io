- **Covariance and Pearson Correlation**
    -  I explored the relationship between different variables and found that as data points varied, the correlation coefficient              changed significantly, reflecting the strength of their relationship.
- **Linear Regression**
    -  By adjusting independent variables, I observed how the regression line fitted the data, emphasizing the importance of                  variable selection.
- **Multiple Linear Regression** 
    - This analysis involved multiple independent variables, revealing how interactions among variables can influence outcomes.
    
- **Polynomial Regression**
    - I compared polynomial fits to linear models and found that polynomial regression could capture more complex relationships              within the data.
