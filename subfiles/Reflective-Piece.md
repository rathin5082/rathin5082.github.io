In my final module, I engaged with two assignments that allowed me to delve into practical applications of machine learning. Both assignments presented unique challenges and learning experiences, which not only enhanced my technical skills but also enabled me to understand the complexities and intricacies involved in selecting optimal modelling strategies.

The first assignment was a team project where I worked with one of my peers to perform machine learning modelling on the Airbnb dataset using Scikit Learn. Two of my team members had done a fantastic job of performing Exploratory Data Analysis, which made the preprocessed dataset optimal to work on. My partner and I set out to do a clustering analysis to identify hidden patterns in the data. One of the significant challenges I encountered was determining which clustering technique was the most appropriate for the given dataset. The two algorithms I considered were K-means and K-prototype. The choice was not straightforward, as both methods have distinct strengths depending on the nature of the dataset. We needed to make the appropriate decision considering our dataset contained both categorical and numerical features.

After going through some research papers, we decided to use the K-prototype algorithm due to its ability to handle mixed data types more effectively than K-means. The research process not only deepened my knowledge of clustering techniques but also underscored the importance of selecting appropriate methods based on data characteristics. Because of the nature of this project, it was essential to make sure that my research findings and methodology matched the objectives of the project as a whole.

In the second assignment, I was tasked with developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) using the Keras library and the CIFAR-10 dataset. The objective was to perform Object Recognition, which presented its own set of challenges. Developing the most appropriate model architecture, which included selecting the optimal number of convolutional filters, neurons in the fully connected layers, and other hyperparameters like the number of epochs and batch size, was one of the most important parts of this task.

The process of finding the right balance was quite possibly the most challenging part of this assignment. It took multiple experiments to understand how different configurations impacted the model’s performance. For instance, adding more filters in the convolutional layers improved the model’s accuracy but also increased the risk of overfitting. Similarly, the choice of batch size influenced the convergence rate and the generalization capability of the model. Ultimately, I achieved approximately 84% accuracy, but the model exhibited slight overfitting, as indicated by a larger gap between training and validation accuracies.

Reflecting on these assignments, I learned a lot about Machine Learning, its capabilities as well as its limitations. The first assignment was a test of my analytical and cooperative skills and in the second, I realized the importance of thorough research, critical thinking, and iterative experimentation when working with machine learning models.

In conclusion, these assignments were instrumental in deepening my knowledge of practical machine-learning techniques. They have prepared me to tackle more challenging problems in the future by equipping me with practical knowledge and a methodical approach to problem-solving.
